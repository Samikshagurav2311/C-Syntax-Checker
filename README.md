# C-Syntax-Checker
 The C Syntax checker to create a program that checks the syntax of a given 
C code file. This project will involve reading a C code file, analyzing its syntax, and 
providing feedback on any syntax errors found. This project is useful for learning 
more about C programming langage syntax and parsing techniques. The Program will 
help people identify common C syntax mistake.  
                   This project aims to develop a C Syntax Checker, a tool designed to 
analyze and verify the syntactic correctness of C programming language code. The 
checker employs lexical analysis and parsing techniques to identify and report syntax 
errors, ensuring adherence to the rule and structure specified by the C language 
grammar.

                * Proposed work  :  
A C syntax checker is a tool that analyzes C code to ensure it follows the correct 
syntax rules of programming language.It can detect syntax error such as missing 
semicolons,mismatch parentheses,undeclared variables,and more.The proposed work 
for a C syntax cheaker would likely involve parsing the code,analyzing its 
structure,and flagging any violations of the languageâ€™s syntax rules.Additionally,it 
could provide helpful error messages to assist devolopers in debugging their code.
